# Data Structure and Algorithms in C++

### What is the Data structures?
- Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data efficiently, enabling operations like searching, insertion, and deletion. 
- Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

### What is the Algorithms?
- Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems or performing tasks, such as sorting, searching, and traversal. 
- They define the logic for manipulating data stored in different data structures.
